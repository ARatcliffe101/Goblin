GOBLIN (Graphical Output Builder for Language Integration & Narration) is a lightweight, portable SSML authoring utility that lets you paste plain text, highlight phrases, and apply speech markup through simple controls while showing the resulting SSML in a live output pane for copy/paste into other tools such an elevenlabs.

It includes a Pronunciation Manager for creating and reusing consistent pronunciations (e.g., phoneme, sub, and say-as entries), with search and filters, plus actions to apply to a selection, insert at the cursor, or apply to all occurrences (best-effort). A Tag Inspector allows you to click existing marked-up regions to review and edit attributes, unwrap tags, or save configurations for reuse. The app also supports undo/redo, a conservative Storyline-safe SSML subset view, and local, browser-only storage for saved pronunciations and snippets, with JSON import/export for portability.
